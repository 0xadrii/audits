# Audit Portfolio - 0xadrii

## About 0xadrii
EVM security researcher focused on smart contract auditing. 
I'm a past alumni from [YAcadamy's block 5 fellowship program](https://yacademy.dev/fellowships/), where I was able to work together with top-tier security researchers.
I'm currently a full-time senior security researcher at [Turing](https://www.turingconsulting.group/), where I perform security reviews as well as gas optimization audits. 
In my free time, I take part in public competitions and bug bounties.
